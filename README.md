# 🗓️ Day 67 – GFG 160 Days DSA Challenge
### 🔗 Problem: Merge Two Sorted Linked Lists
### 📌 Level: Easy – Medium
### 🧠 Core Focus: Linked List Traversal & Sorted Merge
### 🏁 Status: ✅ Problem Solved Successfully

## 🎯 Problem Brief:
You are given two sorted singly linked lists, and the task is to merge them into one sorted linked list.
🔄 This must be done in-place — no new list creations, and optimal space complexity is expected.

## 💡 Strategic Approach:
- To maintain the order while merging:

- Use a dummy node to initiate the merged list.

- Employ two pointers to traverse each list.

- At each step, append the smaller node to the merged list.

- Continue till both lists are exhausted.


This approach ensures:

- Sorted structure preservation

- In-place space efficiency

- Simple yet powerful pointer logic

## ✅ Result Overview:
🔹 Test Cases Passed: 1110 / 1110

🔹 Accuracy: 100%

🔹 Attempts: 1 / 1

🔹 Time Taken: 0.6 seconds

🔹 Points Scored: 4 / 4


## 📊 Complexity Analysis:
- Time Complexity: O(n + m)

- Space Complexity: O(1)

This is one of those “fundamental” problems — often a building block in larger algorithms, like:

- Merge Sort

- Linked List variations

- Competitive coding patterns

## 🔍 Takeaway:
This problem emphasizes the power of clean logic over complex tricks.
When faced with sorted structures, a methodical pointer approach wins.
